# tech-fair-submission
My submission for the 2025/2026 Dekalb County Tech Fair 

This project is a tool that asks for a topic, goes to the wikipedia page for the topic entered by the user, scrapes that page, uses html tags to find the sources for the page, scrapes the sources, and then sends the scraped files to Ollama.

It has 3 main parts

1- Webcrawler.py: parcing and searching data
2- Ai_intergrate.py: uses ai to sum up
3- Cli.py: entry to project + code
