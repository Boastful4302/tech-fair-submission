My submission for the 2025/2026 Dekalb County Tech Fair 

This project is a webcrawler that searches and obtains historical data

TODO:

3 main parts

command line or front end app for the project presentation
LANGCHAIN to connect data into backend, ollama retrieves but we need to make it presentable
